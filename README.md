# tmacs

A better math editor for people like me. Try and use it at http://tmacs.ktj.st

## So why is this even a thing?

Tmacs is a editor that allows you to write KaTeX. It was made for myself, because I was not happy with any other editor I found.
Most of the editors I used didn't render the math in realtime, or if they did, it was very complicated and had a lot of features that I considered useless.

## It doesn't have the features I need!

It's supposed for very light math editing, like taking simple notes during a lesson. If you feel like the feature you're missing fits this purpose, feel free to implement it.
