# tmacs
A better math editor for people like me. Try and use it at http://ktj.st/tmacs
## So why is this even a thing?
Tmacs is a editor that allows you to write KaTeX. It was made for myself, because I was not happy with any other editor I found. 
Most of the editors I used didn't render the math in realtime, or if they did, it was very complicated and had a lot of features that I considered useless.
